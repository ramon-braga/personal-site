            <p class="about-text">I am a calm person who really enjoys computers and video games. In general, technology has always caught my attention because it's so dynamic and transformative. I've always wanted to learn how to program, and I found web development to be a gateway to this world full of possibilities. Currently, I'm focused on becoming a skilled web developer, to master the concepts and technologies used in the job market. My goal is to do a good job on whatever is assigned to me. Pure dedication. In the future, I plan to delve into game programming, in homage to my past self, and who knows, maybe venture into this incredible industry. Please feel free to take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/ramon-braga" target="_blank">Github</a>, where you'll find some small projects I've worked on throughout my learning journey. My journey has been just over 2 months, and it has been a great adventure to learn so many new things every day.</p>
